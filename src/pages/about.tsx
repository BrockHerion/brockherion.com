              I've been interested in computers and programming for as long as I
              can remember. A large part of that was growing up playing games
              like Star Wars: Battlefront, Minecraft, and Skyrim. One of my
              earliest memories was looking up a tutorial on how to build a blog
              and watching a video on Ruby on Rails. I was probably about nine
              or ten at the time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
              My first project I ever did was eigth grade, where I made a
              top-down shooter in Scratch. It was all drag and drop, but it was
              my first exposure to logic and conditionals. After that, I grew an
              interest in iOS but never did anything with it. I instead pursued
              hardware and building my own PC's.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
              I took in Java high school. I then pursued game development,
              learning Unity and C#. Still itching to build websites, I took a
              Web Design and JavaScript course in college. Disatissfied with it,
              I taught myself modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and picked up
              Angular for building web apps. I also focused on Java, C#, and
              Python for building backends for my applications.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
              My current stack revolves around building applications to be fast,
              robust, and scalable. I still use C# on the backend, but use
              Next.JS on the frontend. I also deploy my apps to Vercel and
              really like using Supabase as a database. I enjoy solving
              problems, not fighting with the tools and technology that are
              supposed to help me solve them.

              I'm currently living in the Chicago suburbs with my fiance and our
              three cats. Together, we share our love of Disney, coffee, and
              over-the-top dramatic TV shows. We love taking trips and getting
              to travel with each other. Our wedding is June 4th, 2022 and we
              couldn't be more excited!

              Besides programming, my own hobbies include reading and writing I
              love writing in my journal, studying various technologies, writing
              blog posts, and crafting short stories. I enjoy reading science
              fiction books like Dune and Foundation, but also like books on
              startups, finance, and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
              When I have time, I still really enjoy gaming, specifically
              Minecraft. I love getting servers setup to play with my friends
              and just letting my creativity flow. I was also into creating
              texture packs and mods, but haven't done that in a long time.
              Sometimes, I'll play on modded servers, which lets me push the
              boundaries of creativity even further.
